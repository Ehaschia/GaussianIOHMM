# Mixture Gaussian Input Output Hidden Markov Model

### TODO
* Implement placeholder for mixture gaussian case.
* Unit Test for Mixture Gaussian Sequence Labeling
* grid search tunner:
    * unknown error: not running but the thread is not ready.
    * clean code
* Implement NER part
* Implement new train strategy: first training mu. Then update variance
* Investigate the benefit of our graph model. (Like known several truth label)
* Investigate how to express interpretability.
